      "description": "NRZ-L is a binary encoding technique where a '1' is represented by a high signal and a '0' is represented by a low signal. The signal does not return to a neutral (zero) state between bits, hence the name.",

      "description": "In NRZ-I, a transition occurs at the beginning of a bit interval to represent a '1', while a '0' is represented by no transition. This technique helps reduce the DC component of the signal.",
